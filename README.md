link to json and sql files for our remote transformed data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RnF3TJkEFvk-9UgfaqMEtG1PsEyy3skm?usp=sharing
Due to problems with file size, the files were too large to upload straight to github

## Instructions (Google Colab)
1. Open the Jupypter notebook in Google Colab
2. Download the local file (games.csv) and unsert it into the working directory, usually '/content'
3. Run the block of code
4. User can input what file format they would like their transformed data in
5. Enjoy the summarizations and analyses of the data
